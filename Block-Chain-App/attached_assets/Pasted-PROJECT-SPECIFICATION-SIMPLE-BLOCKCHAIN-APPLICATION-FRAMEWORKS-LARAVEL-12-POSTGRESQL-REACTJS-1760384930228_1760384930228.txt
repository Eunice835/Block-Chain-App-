PROJECT SPECIFICATION — SIMPLE BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION
FRAMEWORKS: LARAVEL 12 • POSTGRESQL • REACTJS • DOCKER (OPTIONAL)
DUE DATE: OCTOBER 24, 2025

SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is an individual project where each student will build a simple blockchain
application that records and validates transactions while demonstrating the core principles of
blockchain security and integrity.
The goal is to help students understand how blockchain ensures data immutability,
transparency, and decentralized verification, even in a simplified environment.

SECTION 2: PROJECT OBJECTIVES
By the end of this project, students should be able to:
• Understand the structure and flow of blockchain transactions.
• Implement a simple blockchain in Laravel that supports block creation and validation.
• Apply cryptographic hash functions for data integrity.
• Demonstrate the immutability and transparency principles of blockchain.
• Build a simple ReactJS interface for viewing and adding transactions.
• Integrate PostgreSQL for storing blocks and transactions persistently.

SECTION 3: FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Transaction Creation
○ A user can submit a transaction (e.g., payment or transfer).
○ Transaction fields include: sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp.
○ Transactions are temporarily stored in a “pending” state until mined into a block.
2. Block Creation (Mining Simulation)
○ The system can group several pending transactions into a block.
○ Each block includes:
• Block index (ID)

• Timestamp
• List of transactions
• Previous block hash
• Current block hash
• Nonce (for proof of work simulation)
○ Hash is generated using SHA256 combining the above details.
3. Blockchain Validation
○ The app should verify that:
• Each block’s hash is valid.
• Each block’s previous hash matches the previous block’s hash.
• The chain is unbroken and unmodified.
○ If a block is tampered with, the system should detect the invalid chain.
4. Proof of Work (Simplified)
○ Implement a basic difficulty rule (e.g., hash must start with two zeros “00”).
○ The user can click “Mine Block” to simulate mining and generate a valid hash.
5. Transaction Ledger View
○ The frontend should display:
• List of all blocks in the chain.
• Transactions contained in each block.
• A visual indicator if the blockchain is valid or broken.

6. Optional Bonus Feature
○ Allow multiple “nodes” to be simulated via API endpoints to show simple
synchronization.

SECTION 4: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
• Blockchain data should persist in PostgreSQL.
• The app should not allow editing or deleting existing blocks.
• Hashes must be generated using a cryptographic function (SHA256).
• Laravel API must validate all inputs and enforce numeric and non-empty rules.

• ReactJS frontend must prevent direct editing of blockchain data.
• Clear and readable UI (use TailwindCSS if available).

SECTION 5: DATABASE DESIGN (RECOMMENDED SCHEMA)
Table: transactions
Fields: id, sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, status (pending/mined), created_at, updated_at
Table: blocks
Fields: id, index_no, previous_hash, current_hash, nonce, timestamp, created_at, updated_at
Table: block_transactions (pivot)
Fields: id, block_id, transaction_id

SECTION 6: BACKEND SPECIFICATION — LARAVEL 12
Subsection 6.1 API Endpoints
POST /api/transaction – create a new transaction (pending)
GET /api/transactions/pending – list all pending transactions
POST /api/block/mine – create a new block using pending transactions
GET /api/blocks – list all blocks
GET /api/blockchain/validate – check blockchain integrity (returns true/false)
Subsection 6.2 Core Classes
1. BlockchainService
○ Responsible for generating hashes and validating the chain.
2. Block Model
○ Represents a mined block with relationships to transactions.
3. Transaction Model
○ Represents a single pending or mined transaction.

Subsection 6.3 Functions

• generateHash(block) – returns SHA256 hash from block data.
• validateChain() – loops through all blocks and confirms hash links.
• mineBlock() – finds a nonce value that satisfies the hash difficulty rule.

SECTION 7: FRONTEND SPECIFICATION — REACTJS
Subsection 7.1 Pages and Components
1. Dashboard Page
○ Buttons: “Create Transaction”, “Mine Block”, “Validate Chain”.
○ Display blockchain validity status (Valid/Invalid).
2. Transactions Page
○ Form for creating a new transaction (sender, receiver, amount).
○ List of pending transactions.
3. Blocks Page
○ Display a list of all blocks with their details and transaction count.
○ Highlight each block’s hash and previous hash.

Subsection 7.2 Optional Enhancements
• Use colored boxes or visual links to represent block connections.
• Add a message log showing mining progress.

SECTION 8: SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
• All hashes must use hash('sha256', $data) in Laravel.
• No direct database editing allowed for blockchain tables.
• Validation rules:
● Amount > 0
● Sender ≠ Receiver

● All fields required
• Ensure that once a block is mined, it cannot be modified.
• Use Laravel middleware for API protection (optional).

SECTION 9: SAMPLE WORKFLOW
1. User creates several transactions (A pays B, B pays C, etc.).
2. User clicks “Mine Block” → system groups all pending transactions.
3. System computes hash until valid (proof of work).
4. Mined block is added to blockchain and saved in database.
5. All transactions in that block become “mined.”
6. The user can validate the blockchain — if valid, display “Blockchain is Secure.”
